                <h2 class="biointro">Steel Inferno is a raging speed metal machinery <br> Straight outta Copenhagen!
                </h2>
                <p>Steel Inferno was formed in 2012 and has since its formation released three full length albums -
                    “Aesthetics of Decay” in 2016 (Inferno Records/Deadbangers Productions), “…And the Earth Stood
                    Still” in 2020 (Deadbangers Productions) and
                    - Evil Reign - in 2022 (From the Vaults)</p>
                <p>The third album - Evil Reign - was crafted after joining forces with new frontman and singer Chris
                    Rostoff in the spring of 2020, just before the world shut down. After signing a deal with <a
                        target="_blank" href="https://fromthevaults.dk">From the Vaults</a> at the end of 2021, the band
                    entered <a href="https://www.angioni-studios.com/" title="Angioni Studios" target="_blank">Angioni
                        Studios</a> in early 2022 and the result is an album that takes the band in a slightly different
                    direction. Check out our <a href="discography.html"
                        title="Steel Inferno Official Discography">discography</a>!
                </p>
                <p>If the band's early material was akin to European metal, like Accept and Judas Priest, it is now
                    closer to some of the earliest US power metal bands, like Helstar, Jag Panzer and maybe even close
                    to Fates Warning at some points - all mixed
                    with our ground influence in the pre-thrash metal bands, like Agent Steel, Savage Grace and early
                    Slayer and Metallica.</p>
                <p>Steel Inferno have played shows with bands like Witch Cross, Burning Witches, Tyranex, Cauldron,
                    Ranger, Altar of Oblivion, Iron Fire and at festivals like Muskelrock in Sweden, Metal Meltdown in
                    Germany and Tornvang, Heavy Agger and Metal
                    Magic in Denmark. Check out this list of <a href="concerts.html"

                <h2 class="article__subheading">Steel Inferno Biography</h2>
                <p>Steel Inferno was established in 2012 by Lars Lyndorff, the band's guitarist and primary songwriter,
                    and drummer Krzysztof Baran, following the dissolution of their former band, Ukrudt. As a child,
                    Lars was inspired by rock bands such as Queen and Europe, and his passion for music was further
                    fueled by Metallica, death metal, and hardcore/punk. Krzysztof, on the other hand, was involved in
                    the post-communist punk underground scene in Poland during his youth. Despite their different
                    backgrounds, the two musicians shared an interest in hardcore music with a crusty edge, which
                    gradually evolved into a desire to play no-nonsense speed/heavy metal with the energy, power, and
                    simplicity of punk and hardcore. </p>
                <p>Thierry Zubritovsky was the first member to join the band, having been hanging around the studio for
                    a long time. Thierry has over four decades of experience in hard rock, having stolen his first
                    records from Kiss, Van Halen, and AC/DC in 1979 before relocating to Denmark due to his love for
                    Pretty Maids.</p>
                <p>Steel Inferno's first incarnation came to be when Karen Collatz responded to an ad on a music site
                    and became the band's lead vocalist. In a predominantly male-oriented metal world, a female-fronted
                    heavy metal band added a new energy to the scene, resulting in a sound that no other band at the
                    time could match. Patrick Mantzouridis was added as a second guitarist to the lineup, and the band
                    played their first show in early 2014, followed by a cassette and a 7-inch record later that year.
                </p>
                <p>The band's debut album, 'Aesthetics of Decay,' was released on CD in 2016 through Infernö Records,
                    and on MC in 2016 and LP in 2017 through Deadbangers Productions. The album's success led to the
                    band being invited to perform at festivals in Denmark, Sweden, and Germany.</p>
                <p>Shortly before the debut album's release, Patrick was replaced by Jens Andersen, a guitarist who,
                    like many others, became interested in playing guitar after listening to Metallica, and was later
                    influenced by bands like Judas Priest, Slayer, Death, and Iron Maiden. On Steel Inferno's second
                    album, '...And the Earth Stood Still,' Jens' impressive guitar solo work can be heard.
                </p>
                <p>Once again the band teamed up with local Copenhagen metal merchant Deadbangers Productions for the
                    release of the album in 2020.</p>
                <p>In early 2020, Karen was replaced by Chris Rostoff, who not only brings youthful energy to the band
                    and stage, but also adds a vocally different touch with inspiration from Agent Steel, Liege Lord,
                    Overkill, and Baloff-era Exodus.
                </p>
                <p>Steel Inferno's latest album, 'Evil Reign,' was released on October 21, 2022.</p>
